This is postShuffle, a forum app written with node.js. It's designed to be
single-page (meaning that once the forum initially loads, all UI is controlled
by client-side code).

# Installation

1. npm install postShuffle
2. vim AppConfig.js # Update all variables in this file as appropriate.
3. node main.js
